# Discreet-Math-Calculator
This C++ program was designed to offer a menu-driven interface for performing various discrete mathematical calculations. It includes functions for finding the Greatest Common Factor (GCF), Least Common Multiple (LCM), checking congruence modulo, verifying prime numbers, and identifying Fibonacci sequence numbers.

The program is designed to offer a range of discrete mathematical tools through a user-friendly interface. It begins by including necessary libraries like iostream for input/output operations and cmath for mathematical calculations. The use of using namespace std; simplifies the code by allowing direct access to standard library functions and objects.

Overview of the functions: 
'gcf':
Calculates the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of two integers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.

'lcm':
Computes the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers a and b based on their GCF.

'congruenceCalculator':
Determines if integers a and b are congruent modulo m by comparing their remainders.

'primeCheck':
Checks if an integer n is a prime number using basic divisibility rules.

'perfSquare':
Verifies if an integer x is a perfect square by computing its square root and checking if squaring the root results in x.

Each function serves a distinct mathematical purpose within the calculator program, enabling operations related to factors, multiples, congruence, prime numbers, and perfect squares.
